        <p>As the sole person working on this extension, I have always been committed to providing users with a
            top-notch experience, completely free of charge. I've been able to do this for quite some time now. But as
            the user base has grown, the time and resources required to keep the extension running smoothly and up to
            date have become increasingly challenging.</p>
        <p>After much consideration, I have made the difficult decision to add premium features to this extension. I
            understand this may not be a popular change with everyone, but I believe it is the best possible way to
            continue offering my continued support and development.</p>
        <p><strong>Starting next month (March), you will notice that mobile searches and a new feature, automated daily
                activities, will be locked behind premium access. I will be offering a lengthy free trial period for all
                current users and a shorter one for new users. Starting the free trial will only require an email for
                verification purposes, no payment method will be necessary.</strong></p>
        <p>The cost of premium access will be very low. Using the extension for a week or two will earn you enough
            points to gain the monetary equivalent of a full year's access. Payments will all be processed through <a target="_blank"
            href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, one of the most used and trusted payment processing platforms.</p>
        <p>Regular searches will still work as they always have. You will also be able to perform mobile searches using
            <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/view-mobile-version-of-website-on-chrome#toc1">Chrome's
                Developer Tools</a>. Just set your view to mobile and run the searches as normal. It is important to me
            that this extension is still usable and useful to everyone without having to pay.
        </p>
        <p>I would like to thank all of the users of this extension for your continued use and support. I look forward
            to further helping you all rack up your rewards points!</p>
        <p>Thanks Everyone!</p>
