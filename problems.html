        <p>It appears that Bing has begun taking a harder stance on blocking this extension. They have been consistently blocking the mobile searches since they were implemented; but I have been able to find work arounds for that. However, this time I don't think it will be possible. In addition, users have started reporting that their accounts are being suspended.</p>
        <P>I no longer feel like the risk of using this extension is worth it and I am deeply sorry for anyone affected by it.</P>
        <p>If you have purchased premium, I will be offering refunds. You can email me at automateyourbingsearches@gmail.com to get that started. I have also unlisted this extension from the Chrome Web Store. You can still continue using the extension after this point, but do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p>I will try to get this fixed, but until I do, these are the measures that I feel must be taken.</p>
        <p>Thank you all so much for using this extension up until now. But for now, I fear this may be the end of it.</p>
